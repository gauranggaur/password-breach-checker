# password-breach-checker

### Python tool that helps you know the number of times the password you want to use or are using has been 
breached/leaked during hacks until now

Use the command `python3 checkmypass.py <password of your choice> <another password of your choice>`

You will get a response like
`lenovo@gaurangcodes:~/Password Checker$ python3 checkmypass.py  hello john@123 jfvfjhvjhvjhvjvjvhjvjh
hello was found 264149 times. You should probably change your password
john@123 was found 423 times. You should probably change your password
jfvfjhvjhvjhvjvjvhjvjh was found 0 times. It is safe to use.`
